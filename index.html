              <h3>Ashley Olsen — Founder & President</h3>
              <p>Hello everyone! My name is Ashley Olsen, Founder and President of Every Body Wellness, and this photo here is the reason why!</p>
              <p>Helping people gain access to real guidance and community has been at the heart of everything I do; as a personal trainer, nutrition coach, and community health advocate. My work focuses on serving those often left out of traditional health spaces. Fitness alone isn’t enough. True health means supporting every part of life, from nutrition and sleep to emotional well-being and daily habits. Our mission is to remove barriers, provide support, and empower people with holistic, realistic plans. We don’t just teach workouts; we help build fulfilling, healthy lives—one step at a time.</p>
              <p>Since December, I’ve led weekly group fitness classes for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It’s been deeply rewarding to see confidence grow, community strengthen, and overall well-being improve. The skills and movements practiced in class have helped increase mobility, strength, and quality of life. Too often, underserved members of our community from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities are excluded from fitness spaces due to assumptions about what they can or should do. Movement is accessible and essential for everyone, regardless of ability, background, or financial situation.</p>
              <p>In April, I founded Every Body Wellness to expand this mission and bring inclusive wellness programs to more people. I believe together we can build a stronger, healthier community and create lasting change.</p>

              <h3>Madeline — VP & Treasurer</h3>
              <p>I’m Madeline, Vice President and current Treasurer of Every Body Wellness. I’ve been working closely with Ashley, our President, since the beginning of this nonprofit. When she first shared the idea of building a collaborative holistic wellness & fitness space, I knew I had to be part of it.</p>
              <p>Growing up, I didn’t consider myself athletic. I never believed I was the kind of person who could do, let alone enjoy, physical activity. Since I was a teen, I struggled with body image and self-worth, but it wasn’t until I hit my own rock bottom that I realized I needed to change something.</p>
              <p>Through weightlifting, balanced eating, and small changes in how I moved and treated my body, I started building not just the body I wanted, but the life I wanted. Fitness gave me a way to manage anxiety, find peace, and reconnect with myself in ways I didn’t think were possible.</p>
              <p>Now, I want to help others find and realize their personal transformation. I’m passionate about making wellness realistic, sustainable, and welcoming for everyone. Our team isn’t just here to preach “fitness”. We meet you where you are, support you in finding what feels good, and connect you with real resources and real people who are just as invested in personal growth as you are.</p>

              <h3>Jessica — Member</h3>
              <p>I’m Jessica, a passionate climber, researcher, and a member of Every Body Wellness. For me, wellness includes not just therapy, but also movement, meditation, nutrition, sleep, and community.</p>
              <p>I’m a Clinical Psychology doctoral student at Oregon State University. My research interests include examining behavioral health interventions, particularly with a focus on sleep, with the goal of promoting well-being. I’m particularly interested in working with athletes and people with disabilities, specifically those who experience chronic pain. I’m deeply committed to advancing psychological science in ways that are inclusive, empowering, and accessible.</p>
              <p>I believe that science should serve everybody. That means increasing the accessibility and relevance of psychological research, and ensuring that the knowledge generated reaches the people who need it.</p>

              <h3>Kennedy — Fitness Program Assistant</h3>
              <p>Hi there! I’m Kennedy, a proud member of Every Body Wellness. I am an avid weight-lifter, and I find a lot of enjoyment and stress-relief from physical activity. Health and wellness are important to me, and go so much deeper than exercise.</p>
              <p>I am a nursing graduate, with my Bachelors in Science of Nursing from George Fox University. I will be beginning a job as a new graduate resident on the Neuro Care Unit at Salem Health hospital. I think optimal health and wellness should be accessible to everyone in their life, no matter their current lifestyle. Providing opportunities for anyone to get the help and resources they need to be successful in their health journey is incredibly important to me.</p>
              <p>As a member of EBW, I hope to serve the surrounding community by helping empower surrounding community residents with their health struggles.</p>

              <h3>Hannah — Integrative Nutrition Health Coach & Wellness Program Assistant</h3>
              <p>As a mom of two amazing kids I know firsthand how challenging it can be to prioritize your own well-being while juggling everything life throws at you. That’s why I’m so passionate about helping others create real, lasting change that fits their real lives.</p>
              <p>I’m not just a coach—I practice what I preach. From mindful eating to self-care routines and intentional movement, I’ve built a wellness lifestyle that supports both my health and my family—and I love helping others do the same in a way that feels sustainable, empowering, and personal.</p>
              <p>When Ashley came to me with the idea of starting Every Body Wellness, I was immediately excited. The mission to create an inclusive, supportive space where wellness is truly for every body deeply resonated with me. It’s been an incredible journey to help bring that vision to life.</p>
              <p>Whether you’re trying to feel more energized, reduce stress, improve your relationship with food, or simply take better care of yourself, I’m here to support you—no judgment, just real support and real results.</p>

              <h3>Kim — Behavioral Health Consultant</h3>
              <p>I hated exercise. I hated healthy food, meditation, deep breathing, stretching— and at times, I hated myself too.</p>
              <p>But after working in the hospital during COVID, especially the ICU and COVID-19 ward, the things I HATED became how I fought for my life. Wellness didn’t start in a beautiful place for me. It didn’t start from a place of love, compassion, or even self-care. Wellness started when I had the option to die, or fight.</p>
              <p>My journey to where I am now has consisted of failed attempts over and over again, and maintained with a death grip.</p>
              <p>I left my medical job and earned my degree in Health Counseling and Psychology, emphasizing Neuroscience: specifically how daily habits can either protect, or diminish brain health (highly in reference to neurodegeneration). I have now worked in the behavioral health field for the last 3 years, working 1:1 with a caseload of diverse individuals that present with impeding behaviors.</p>
              <p>For me—like so many others—movement, mental health recognition, and overall wellness is about survival. It’s about increasing my physiological protective mechanisms so that when the hard times come (and they always will), I have the grit to fight back.</p>
              <p>Every Body Wellness is building a community of incredibly strong humans that want to help you fight for your life. On the good days, we’re here to cheer you on—and on the bad days, we’re here to give you a reminder to keep going. Your future is worth fighting for, and we want to help you.</p>
